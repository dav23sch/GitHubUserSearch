When looking at starting this project I was able to find someone who had created a Visual Studio template for Vue JS 3.0 and
Asp.Net Core 5.0 applications. Which can be found here
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexandredotnet.vuejsdotnetfive

I decided to use that as my base and build off of it using Home.vue as my front end file and made User Controller for the api call.

Excited to talk to you all about questions you may have!
